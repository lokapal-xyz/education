HowToDAO is the educational initiative of Lokapal, designed to make decentralized governance and DAOs accessible to everyone. Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced DAO participant, HowToDAO provides structured guidance to help you navigate and understand the world of decentralized organizations.

## Our Approach
HowToDAO is built to serve both technical and non-technical audiences:
- A [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/lokapal-xyz/howtodao/) tailored for developers, providing hands-on resources, code examples, and technical deep dives.
- A **website** designed for a broader audience, offering clear explanations, structured learning paths, and practical insights.
- A blend of **beginner-friendly** introductions and **advanced** explorations of governance models, smart contracts, and DAO security.
