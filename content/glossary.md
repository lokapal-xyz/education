This glossary provides definitions of key terms related to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).

**A**

* **Access Control:**
    * The mechanisms used to determine who has permission to perform specific actions within a DAO, such as voting or accessing treasury funds.
* **Address (Blockchain):**
    * A unique identifier on a blockchain network, used to send and receive digital assets.

**B**

* **Blockchain:**
    * A distributed and immutable ledger that records transactions and data across a network of computers.

**C**

* **Community Governance:**
    * A decision-making process where the community of DAO members collectively determines the organization's direction.
* **Consensus Mechanism:**
    * The method by which a blockchain network validates transactions and reaches agreement on the current state of the ledger.

**D**

* **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization):**
    * An organization run by rules encoded as smart contracts on a blockchain, eliminating the need for traditional hierarchical management.
* **Decentralized Governance:**
    * A system of governance where decision-making power is distributed among a network of participants, rather than concentrated in a central authority.
* **Delegation:**
    * The process by which a DAO member assigns their voting power to another member or entity. This allows for more efficient governance and representation.
* **DeFi (Decentralized Finance):**
    * Financial applications and services built on blockchain technology.

**G**

* **Gas Fees:**
    * Transaction fees paid to miners or validators on a blockchain network, typically used to compensate for the computational effort required to process transactions.
* **Governance:**
    * The rules and processes that determine how a DAO makes decisions and operates.

**I**

* **Interoperability:**
    * The ability of different blockchain networks and DAOs to communicate and interact with each other.

**O**

* **On-Chain Governance:**
    * Governance processes that are conducted directly on a blockchain, using smart contracts to automate voting and execution.
* **Off-Chain Governance:**
    * Governance processes that occur outside of the blockchain, such as discussions on forums or social media, before on-chain votes.

**P**

* **Proposal:**
    * A formal suggestion or plan submitted to a DAO for consideration by its members.

**R**

* **Reputation System:**
    * A mechanism for tracking and evaluating the contributions and behavior of DAO members, often used to incentivize participation and good governance.

**S**

* **Smart Contract:**
    * A self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.
* **Snapshot:**
    * A method of recording token balances at a particular block height, used for voting, airdrops, and other functions.
* **SubDAO:**
    * A smaller, more focused DAO that operates within a larger DAO, often with specific objectives or responsibilities.

**T**

* **Tokenomics:**
    * The study of the economics of a cryptocurrency or token, including its supply, distribution, and utility.
* **Treasury:**
    * The pool of digital assets held by a DAO, used to fund its operations and initiatives.

**V**

* **Voting:**
    * The process by which DAO members express their preferences on proposals and decisions.

**W**

* **Web3:**
    * The next generation of the internet, characterized by decentralization, blockchain technology, and user ownership.
