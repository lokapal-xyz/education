In the decentralized ecosystem, DAOs often need to interact with other smart contracts and coordinate with multiple DAOs to achieve their objectives. We must delve into the various on-chain interactions that DAOs engage in, from interacting with non-DAO smart contracts to coordinating actions with other DAOs.

This section covers the following key topics:

- **Interacting with Non-DAO Smart Contracts**  
  DAOs frequently interact with external smart contracts beyond their own governance structures. This topic will explore how DAOs can integrate with DeFi protocols, NFTs, and other decentralized applications (dApps), ensuring seamless interaction with the broader blockchain ecosystem.

- **Governance Automation and Execution Frameworks**  
  To streamline governance processes and decision-making, many DAOs implement automation frameworks. This section will discuss various tools and frameworks used to automate governance actions, such as proposal execution, smart contract interactions, and other operational processes within the DAO.

- **Multi-DAO Integration**  
  As DAOs proliferate, the need for cross-DAO coordination grows. We will explore governance models that involve multiple DAOs working together, including shared decision-making, joint proposals, and collaborations to ensure that collective actions are aligned and effective.

By the end of this section, you will understand the mechanisms and strategies for enabling DAOs to interact with non-DAO smart contracts, automate governance processes, and collaborate with other DAOs to achieve common goals.
