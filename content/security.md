## Disclaimer

The HowToDAO repository is an educational resource designed to help users understand decentralized governance structures and smart contract implementations. The code in this repository is not production-ready and should not be used in live deployments without a professional security audit.

## Reporting Security Issues

Since this repository is for educational purposes only, security vulnerabilities in example code should not be reported as GitHub issues. If you identify a security risk in real-world DAO implementations inspired by this repository, please follow the responsible disclosure process of the respective project.

## Best Practices for Security

If you plan to adapt any code from this repository for production, consider the following:

- Conduct a comprehensive security audit before deployment.
- Use formal verification and fuzz testing where applicable.
- Follow best practices for access control, upgradeability, and governance security.

## Acknowledgments

We encourage contributions that improve the educational value of this repository. However, security-related discussions should be framed as educational improvements rather than vulnerability reports.
