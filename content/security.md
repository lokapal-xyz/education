## Disclaimer

The HowToDAO website is an educational resource designed to help users understand decentralized governance structures and smart contract implementations. The code hosted or linked in this website is not production-ready and should not be used in live deployments without a professional security audit.

## Security Issues

Since this website is for educational purposes only, security vulnerabilities in example code should not be reported on GitHub discussions. If you identify a security risk in real-world DAO implementations inspired by this website, please follow the responsible disclosure process of the respective project.

## Best Practices for Security

If you plan to adapt any code from this website for production, consider the following:

- Conduct a comprehensive security audit before deployment.
- Use formal verification and fuzz testing where applicable.
- Follow best practices for access control, upgradeability, and governance security.

## Acknowledgments

We encourage contributions that improve the educational value of this website. However, security-related discussions should be framed as educational improvements rather than vulnerability reports.
